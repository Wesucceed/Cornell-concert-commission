# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - To contribute to the discussion in group meetings
    - To listen to the client
    - Comply with university branding and accessibility standards
    - Contribute high quality effort/work to the project

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Be respectful
    - Be communicative
    - Be timely
    - Be collaborative
    - Be open to changes

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will meet with each other at least twice a week and communicate often througout the week.

    - primary communication channel will be WhatsApp group chat
    - emails, as needed
    - at least one zoom call a week

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We will communicate with our client at least once a week for check ins.
    - email check-ins

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    Everyone will be responsible for one page of content and making sure it is cohesive with the rest of the group's pages.

    Kyrah: Main point of contact with our client

    Lana: Our communcations liason to make sure all meetings are happening when they need to and making sure we are comlying with university guildelines

    Jephthah: Main content organizer and enseure usability

    Tanya: Double checks the project before we commit

    **If we are creating a website for a university affiliated group, we will need to make sure we take into consideration and follow brand guidelines per university SCL policies.**

    -<https://brand.cornell.edu/design-center/>


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We will communicate with each other to let the other members know if we need help or are under a lot of stress. If a teammate fails to deliver, we will respectfully talk with them and figure out how to resolve the issue.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    When we disagree, we will talk about the issue until we come to a compromise or agreement.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    We will revist as needed.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
