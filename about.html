        <h2>Working a Show</h2>

        <p>CCC members do far more than simply selecting artists to come to Cornell, as all CCC sponsored shows are student produced. The production is split into 6 crews: Security, Stage, Box Office, Merchandise, Hospitality, and Ticket Taking. Members who have attended the most meetings and promoted the event are given preference to their desired crew.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Security</span> - Led by the Executive Director, the security crew is responsible for overlooking the audience at key locations of the venue and securing the backstage area. This crew is a half-day crew.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Stage</span> - Led by the Productions Director, the stage crew is responsible for the setting up and breaking down the stage, lights, and sound of the concert during the day. During the show, the stage crew doubles as security members. This crew is a full-day crew.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Box Office</span> - Led by the Finance Director, the box office is responsible for selling tickets at the door and attending to the will call tickets. This crew is a half-day crew.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Merchandise</span> - Led by the Promotions Director, the merchandise crew is responsible for the selling of any merchandise provided by the artist. The Promotions Director is also responsible for handling press. This crew is a half-day crew.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Hospitality</span> - Led by the Administrative Director, the hospitality crew is responsible for the preparation of the artists&rsquo; dressing rooms, as well as providing food for both the crews and the artists. This is a full-day crew.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Ticket Taking</span> - Led by the Selections Director, the ticket takers are responsible for scanning and collecting tickets, as well as confiscating any items that cannot be brought into the venue.</p>
