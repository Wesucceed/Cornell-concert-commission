### Bacground
> CCC was founded in 1971. It is a unit of the Campus Activities Office, Department of Campus and Community Engagement, and is funded in part by the SA and GPSA.

> Stage - Led by the Productions Director, the stage crew is responsible for the setting up and breaking down the stage, lights, and sound of the concert during the day. During the show, the stage crew doubles as security members. This crew is a full-day crew.
> Box Office - Led by the Finance Director, the box office is responsible for selling tickets at the door and attending to the will call tickets. This crew is a half-day crew.
> Merchandise - Led by the Promotions Director, the merchandise crew is responsible for the selling of any merchandise provided by the artist. The Promotions Director is also responsible for handling press. This crew is a half-day crew.
> Hospitality - Led by the Administrative Director, the hospitality crew is responsible for the preparation of the artists’ dressing rooms, as well as providing food for both the crews and the artists. This is a full-day crew.

### Co-Sponsorship
> CCC is always open to assist funding to outside organizations for the production of musical events. Working alongside organizations such as SPICMACAY, Haven, JAM, and ASHA Cornell, CCC has been able to fund and help produce acts ranging from Bulgarian and Indian folk music to LGBTQ raves. If you are interested in having CCC co-sponsor your organization, please reach out to finance director Victoria Reiter at ver22@cornell.edu.
> Once the co-sponsorship is submitted, the CCC e-board will ask a representative of the organization to come to an e-board meeting. There, the representative will be asked to give a presentation of the event, covering the event’s purpose, amount requested, budgeting, promotional plans, and more. If the executive board approves the event, the representative is asked to present once more at the General Body (gbody) meeting. The gbody will ask questions and and ultimately decide whether or not to fund the event, and if so, determine the amount of funding.
